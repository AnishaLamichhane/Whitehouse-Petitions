# Whitehouse-Petitions
challenge of Project7 of #hackingWithSwift by Paul Hudson.

#Challenge
  - Add a Credits button to the top-right corner using UIBarButtonItem. When this is tapped, show an alert telling users the data comes from the We The People API       of the Whitehouse.
  - Let users filter the petitions they see. This involves creating a second array of filtered items that contains only petitions matching a string the user             entered. Use a UIAlertController with a text field to let them enter that string. This is a tough one, so I’ve included some hints below if you get stuck.
  - Experiment with the HTML – this isn’t a HTML or CSS tutorial, but you can find lots of resources online to give you enough knowledge to tinker with the layout a     little.
